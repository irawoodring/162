Arthur C. Clarke (a very famous science fiction writer) proposed 3 laws concerning technology:

- When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

- The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.

- Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
---
I have spent a great deal of time thinking about the third law.  I believe it is absolutely correct.  As a matter of fact, I've noticed some things over the years that reinforce this idea and helped me develop a hypothesis.

Wizards don't do magic.  They just know stuff.

The first time I realized this might be true was when I was reading *The Once and Future King* by T.H. White.  It is a King Arthur story - one of the best.  In it, Arthur comes across Merlyn's house in the woods.  The house is separated into two parts, an upper and a lower level.  The upper level is a bedroom/study.  Here is the description:

The contents of this room don't seem "magical".  There are books, live and dead animals, an astrolabe, even a set of encyclopedias.

Merlyn wasn't a magician, he was a scholar!
---
We can see the same thing in The Lord of the Rings.  In the movies we get glimpses of the inside of Saruman's tower (for those of you who don't know he was a wizard gone bad!).

In it, we see exactly the same type of room Merlyn had:

Books, animals in jars, a scale for measuring.

Saruman was a scholar too.

In Harry Potter the same sort of elements appear.  The students study plants, animals, chemistry, etc.  Almost every time there is a major problem Hermione (easily the best wizard of the three) runs to the library to find an answer:
---
“Harry — I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library!”
And she sprinted away, up the stairs.
“What does she understand?” said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from.
“Loads more than I do,” said Ron, shaking his head.
“But why’s she got to go to the library?”
“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.”
― J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

Even in the comics this idea appears!

>Jane Foster: Describe exactly what happened to you last night.

>Thor: Your ancestors called it magic...

>[Thor skims through a book on Norse mythology]

>Thor: ...but you call it science. I come from a land where they are one and the same.

---
So magic is just what people attribute to phenomena they don't understand.  And science helps us to understand.
---
Even my own experience has reinforced this idea.  I was a System's Administrator for years.  It was very common for me to help someone and have them say "Wow, you're magic!"

Yes, yes I am!  Because I understand the science behind it.
