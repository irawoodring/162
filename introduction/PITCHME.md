CIS 162 - Introduction

Arthur C. Clarke (a very famous science fiction writer) proposed 3 laws concerning technology:

- When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

- The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.

- Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

I have spent a great deal of time thinking about the third law.  I believe it is absolutely correct.  As a matter of fact, I've noticed some things over the years that reinforce this idea and helped me develop a hypothesis.

Wizards don't do magic.  They just know stuff.

The first time I realized this might be true was when I was reading *The Once and Future King* by T.H. White.  It is a King Arthur story - one of the best.  In it, Arthur comes across Merlyn's house in the woods.  The house is separated into two parts, an upper and a lower level.  The upper level is a bedroom/study.  Here is the description:

The contents of this room don't seem "magical".  There are books, live and dead animals, an astrolabe, even a set of encyclopedias.

Merlyn wasn't a magician, he was a scholar!

We can see the same thing in The Lord of the Rings.  In the movies we get glimpses of the inside of Saruman's tower (for those of you who don't know he was a wizard gone bad!).

In it, we see exactly the same type of room Merlyn had:
